            <p class="fs-5 text-break">This project was developed by two students Mohit Kumar and Shobha Rajanna from the
                Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg (FAU) for the seminar
                <a href="https://www.ti.rw.fau.de/courses/hot-topics-in-web-technologies-and-the-internet-of-things/"

                    Internet of Things</a>
            </p>
            <p class="fs-5 text-break">The goal of our topic was to develop a microservice that detects the
                ASL hand gesture of a user based on his hand orientation. A camera-based application for
                Hand Gesture Recognition shall be the presented at the end of the semester.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-5 text-break"> We have used google mediapipe to recognize hand features and train a model on
                these features. </p>
